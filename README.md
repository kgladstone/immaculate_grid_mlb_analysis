# Immaculate Grid Analysis
The overall goal of this repository is to automate analyses related to Immaculate Grid performance from a group of players who send their results via Apple Messages.

## Analysis Scripts
1. Database Refresher (`refresh_db.py`) --> process grid results that are sent over text and stored locally in a chat database
2. `immaculate-grid-scraper.ipynb` --> Jupyter notebook to run on the parsed message data and generate graphs and insights
3. Prompt Scraper (`immaculate_grid_prompt_scraper.py`) --> webscraper to compile dataset of all daily grid prompts

## Skill Practice
4. Simulator --> interactive game for users to test their skills
